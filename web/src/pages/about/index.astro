        This Contact Time Calculator calculates the amount of contact time
        needed to provide adequate inactivation of Giardia and viruses for a
        range of disinfectants. These calculations can be useful for determining
        compliance with the Surface Water Treatment Rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        The amount contact time needed is determined from user inputs of the
        type of disinfectant, the logs of inactivation needed, temperature, pH,
        and disinfectant residual. The calculator uses the methods and tables in
        EPA Manual EPA815-R-99-013, titled “Disinfection Profiling and
        Benchmarking Guidance Manual”, dated August 1999, for determining the
        amount of inactivation needed.
